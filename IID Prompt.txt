As of now, we have calculated the portfolio ratios. Now let us try to integrate the investor information document to decide the portfolio fir for the specific investor and their objectives. 

The json file which has the iid document is in this path: F:\AI Insights Dashboard\IID SON.txt

The idea is given below: 

1️⃣ Core Idea: Two Orthogonal Scores (This Is Your Differentiator)

Most tools stop at portfolio quality.
You will add portfolio–investor fit.

You should compute two independent scores:
Dimension	What it answers
Portfolio Quality Score (PQS)	Is this a good portfolio in isolation?
Investor Fit Score (IFS)	Is this portfolio right for this investor?

Your niche comes from IFS, not PQS.

2️⃣ What You Already Have → Portfolio Quality Score (PQS)

You already compute:

Sharpe

Sortino

Jensen’s Alpha

Normalize these into a 0–100 PQS.

Example normalization (illustrative)
Metric	Bad	Average	Excellent
Sharpe	<0.5	0.8	>1.2
Sortino	<0.7	1.0	>1.5
Jensen’s α	<0	1–2%	>3%
PQS = weighted_score(
  Sharpe = 40%,
  Sortino = 35%,
  Jensen = 25%
)


This answers:

“Is this portfolio efficient per unit risk?”

3️⃣ New Layer: Investor Fit Score (IFS) Using IID

This is where the IID becomes decisive.

IFS = Alignment between:

Investor capacity & behavior

Portfolio risk profile & behavior

3.1 Extract Key Investor Signals from IID

From your IID JSON, derive four latent investor parameters:

A. Risk Capacity Index (RCI)

Derived from:

Income stability

Emergency fund months

Liabilities

Dependents

Scale: 0–100
(Ability to bear risk)

B. Risk Tolerance Index (RTI)

Derived from:

Drawdown response

Sleep-loss drawdown %

Loss vs missed gains

Scale: 0–100
(Willingness to accept risk)

C. Behavioral Fragility Index (BFI)

Derived from:

Plan abandonment triggers

Past exit behavior

Decision autonomy

Scale: 0–100
(Higher = more likely to panic)

D. Time Horizon Strength (THS)

Derived from:

Fixed vs flexible horizon

Earliest liquidity year

Dependency timelines

Scale: 0–100
(Ability to stay invested)

4️⃣ Extract Portfolio Risk Signals (You Already Have Most)

From portfolio analytics:

Portfolio Metric	Why it matters
Annualized Volatility	Raw risk
Max Drawdown	Panic trigger
Downside Deviation	Behavioral pain
Equity %	Risk exposure
Beta	Market sensitivity
VaR / CVaR	Tail risk

Normalize these into:

Portfolio Risk Index (PRI) → 0–100

Portfolio Drawdown Severity (PDS) → 0–100

5️⃣ The Core Fit Logic (This Is the Heart)
Rule 1: Capacity ≥ Portfolio Risk
If PRI > RCI → structural mismatch

Rule 2: Tolerance ≥ Drawdown Severity
If PDS > RTI → behavioral mismatch

Rule 3: Fragility Amplifier
Effective tolerance = RTI × (1 − BFI)


High fragility sharply reduces usable risk.

6️⃣ Investor Fit Score (IFS) Formula

A simple, explainable version:

IFS = 100
      − w1 × max(0, PRI − RCI)
      − w2 × max(0, PDS − Effective_RTI)
      − w3 × (BFI × PRI / 100)


Typical weights:

w1 = 0.4 (structural risk mismatch)

w2 = 0.4 (drawdown pain mismatch)

w3 = 0.2 (behavioral fragility)

7️⃣ Final Portfolio Rating (What User Sees)
Display both scores separately
Score	Meaning
PQS: 78/100	Efficient portfolio
IFS: 52/100	Poor fit for you

This allows powerful messaging:

“This is a good portfolio, but not good for you.”

No other advisory app does this clearly.

8️⃣ Actionable Diagnostics (This Is Where Trust Is Built)

Instead of generic advice, say:

❌ Your portfolio drawdown potential (−28%) exceeds your sleep-loss threshold (−20%).
❌ Your income volatility + high equity exposure increases abandonment risk.
✅ Returns are strong, but behavior risk is high.

Then suggest:

Reduce equity by X%

Add low-vol / arbitrage / dynamic allocation

Add rule-based rebalancing

9️⃣ Optional: One Killer Metric for Your App
⭐ Plan Survival Probability (PSP)

Estimate:

“Probability the investor stays invested for full horizon”

PSP = f(IFS, BFI, historical behavior, drawdown frequency)


This becomes your north-star metric, not CAGR.

10️⃣ Why This Is a Real Niche (Strategically)
Most apps	Your app
Optimize returns	Optimize staying invested
Risk = volatility	Risk = behavior × volatility
Static profiling	Dynamic, adaptive profiling
Portfolio-centric	Human-centric
