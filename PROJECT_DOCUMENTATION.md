# Streamlit Dashboard (dashboard.py)

## 🖥️ Interactive Web Dashboard

The Streamlit dashboard (`dashboard.py`) provides a user-friendly web interface for portfolio health analysis. It allows users to upload their portfolio, view key metrics, and explore detailed analysis across multiple tabs.

### Features

- **Portfolio Upload**: Upload your Excel portfolio or specify a file path in the sidebar.
- **Investor Profile Form**: Enter personal and investment details to calculate Investor Fit Score (IFS).
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: View results in interactive tabs:
  - **📊 Overview**: Portfolio value, annual return, Sharpe ratio, health score, and holdings table.
  - **🎯 Two-Dimensional Analysis**: Portfolio Quality Score (PQS), Investor Fit Score (IFS), Plan Survival Probability, quadrant chart, and interpretation.
  - **📈 Portfolio Quality**: Detailed breakdown of PQS, risk metrics (VaR, drawdown, volatility, beta, Jensen's alpha).
  - **👤 Investor Fit**: Radar chart and metrics for investor profile indices, mismatches, and diagnostics.
  - **💼 Portfolio Details**: Full holdings table, download option, and complete JSON report.
  - **🧮 Optimized Allocation**: Classic optimization (no ML) to maximize Sharpe Ratio. Shows recommended asset weights and optimized portfolio metrics using real historical price data.
  - **🎯 Asset Recommendations** ⭐ **[NEW]**: Identifies underperforming assets to drop and recommends high-scoring assets to add from the full Nifty50+Next50 universe. Includes implementation roadmap and expected impact analysis.

### How It Works

1. **Upload Portfolio**: Use the sidebar to upload your Excel file or enter a path.
2. **Enter Investor Info**: Fill out the form for personalized analysis.
3. **Run Analysis**: Click "🔍 Run Analysis" to generate results.
4. **Explore Tabs**: Navigate through tabs for detailed insights and recommendations.
5. **Optimized Allocation**: Go to the "Optimized Allocation" tab to see the recommended asset weights that maximize Sharpe Ratio, calculated using your real price data.
6. **Asset Recommendations** ⭐: Go to the "🎯 Asset Recommendations" tab to discover:
   - Which underperforming assets to drop from your portfolio
   - Which high-quality Nifty 50 assets to add with calculated weights
   - Complete new portfolio composition with updated weight allocation
   - Detailed rationale for each recommendation based on multi-dimensional scoring
   - Three-phase implementation strategy with timeline
   - Expected impact on portfolio metrics (returns, volatility, Sharpe ratio)

### Technical Notes

- The optimization uses `scipy.optimize.minimize` to find the asset weights that maximize the Sharpe Ratio, subject to constraints (weights sum to 1, no shorting).
- All metrics are calculated using real historical price data downloaded from yfinance.
- No machine learning is used for optimization; the approach is fully transparent and based on financial mathematics.
- Asset recommendations are generated by scoring Nifty 50 stocks using a multi-dimensional methodology (return alignment, volatility, Sharpe ratio, drawdown, diversification) and analyzing Sharpe-based underperformance in existing holdings.
- New portfolio weights are calculated by redistributing weight from dropped assets to new additions, with normalization to ensure 100% total allocation.

### 6. **Asset Universe Recommendations** ⭐ **[NEW]**
Identifies assets to add/drop from the Nifty50 universe:

#### **Asset Selection from Nifty 50**
The system analyzes the Nifty 50 index (50 stocks) to recommend optimal additions to the portfolio:

**Asset Universe**:
- **Nifty 50**: Top 50 blue-chip stocks by market capitalization
- Excludes assets already in the current portfolio
- Focuses on high-quality, liquid stocks with sufficient trading history

**Scoring Methodology (0-100 scale)**:
Each asset is scored across multiple dimensions:

1. **Return Alignment (25 points)**:
   - Checks if asset's annual return falls within objective's target range
   - Conservative: 8-15%, Moderate: 12-20%, Aggressive: 15-35%
   - Awards full points if return aligns with investment objective

2. **Volatility Check (20 points)**:
   - Evaluates if asset's volatility is acceptable for objective
   - Conservative: ≤15%, Moderate: ≤22%, Aggressive: ≤35%
   - Ensures risk level matches investor's risk tolerance

3. **Sharpe Ratio Quality (20 points)**:
   - Assesses risk-adjusted returns
   - Conservative: ≥0.8, Moderate: ≥1.0, Aggressive: ≥1.2
   - Higher Sharpe indicates better returns per unit of risk

4. **Maximum Drawdown (15 points)**:
   - Maximum peak-to-trough decline must be ≤50%
   - Indicates capital preservation quality
   - Lower drawdown = more stable investment

5. **Diversification Benefit (20 points)**:
   - Analyzes correlation with current portfolio returns
   - Correlation <0.5 earns full points (low correlation)
   - Low correlation reduces overall portfolio risk

**Asset Metrics Calculated**:
- Annual Returns (mean daily return × 252)
- Annualized Volatility (std dev of returns × √252)
- Sharpe Ratio: (Return - Risk Free Rate) / Volatility
- Sortino Ratio: (Return - Risk Free Rate) / Downside Volatility
- Maximum Drawdown: Largest peak-to-trough decline

**Underperformance Detection**:
Identifies portfolio holdings that significantly underperform:
- Compares each asset's Sharpe ratio vs. portfolio Sharpe ratio
- Flags assets with underperformance >0.3 on Sharpe basis
- Considers asset weight in portfolio for removal priority
- Provides quantified underperformance metrics

**Portfolio Rebalancing**:
- **Weight Redistribution**: Weight from dropped assets is redistributed equally to new assets
- **Normalization**: All portfolio weights normalized to sum to 100%
- **New Portfolio Display**: Shows complete portfolio composition with updated weights
- **Clear Marking**: New additions and existing holdings clearly identified

**Implementation Roadmap**:
- Phase 1: Gradually reduce underperformers (1-2 weeks)
- Phase 2: Add recommended assets with calculated weights (3-8 weeks)
- Phase 3: Monitor and rebalance (ongoing)

**Expected Impact**: Quantifies improvements in returns, volatility, and overall portfolio alignment
**Rationale**: Each recommendation includes specific reasons for add/drop decisions

### 7. **Objective Alignment Scoring**
- Pre-defined objectives:
  - **Conservative Income**: Low risk, stable returns
  - **Moderate Growth**: Balanced risk-return
  - **Aggressive Growth**: High risk, high returns
- Individual component scores (0-100):
  - Return score
  - VaR score
  - Sharpe ratio score
  - Volatility score
  - Sortino ratio score
- Overall alignment score with categorization

### 8. **Portfolio Health Classification**
- **3-Tier Health Status**:
  - ✅ **Healthy** (Score: 80-100)
  - ⚠️ **Warning** (Score: 60-79)
  - ❌ **At Risk** (Score: <60)
- Component breakdown:
  - Performance score
  - Risk management score

## 📈 Metrics Explained

### **Sharpe Ratio**
- Measures risk-adjusted returns
- Higher is better (>1 is good, >2 is excellent)
- Formula: `(Return - Risk_Free_Rate) / Volatility`

### **Sortino Ratio**
- Similar to Sharpe but penalizes only downside volatility
- Better for asymmetric return distributions
- Higher values indicate better downside risk management

### **Jensen's Alpha**
- Excess return over expected return (CAPM)
- Positive alpha = outperformance
- Measures manager skill vs. market exposure

### **Value at Risk (VaR)**
- Maximum expected loss at given confidence level
- VaR(95%) = loss not exceeded 95% of the time
- Used for risk budgeting and limits

### **Beta**
- Portfolio sensitivity to market movements
- β < 1: Less volatile than market
- β = 1: Moves with market
- β > 1: More volatile than market

## 🎓 Technical Approach

### Why Hybrid System (Not Pure ML)?

**Decision Rationale**:
1. **Domain Logic**: Portfolio health involves business rules (VaR thresholds, objective definitions) that are better expressed as rules than learned
2. **Data Requirements**: ML models need large training datasets; most users have limited portfolio history
3. **Interpretability**: Stakeholders need to understand why a portfolio is classified as "At Risk"
4. **Regulatory**: Financial decisions often require auditable, explainable logic
5. **Accuracy**: For well-defined metrics (VaR, Sharpe), mathematical formulas are more accurate than approximations

**ML Enhancement Opportunities** (Future):
- Anomaly detection in portfolio behavior
- Predictive models for future health trends
- Pattern recognition across similar portfolios
- Optimization recommendations

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No data fetched for stocks
**Solution**: Check ticker symbols are correct for NSE (.NS suffix)

### Issue: Mutual fund not found
**Solution**: Use full, exact fund name or check MFAPI search results

### Issue: Upstox historical data fails
**Solution**: Upstox requires paid subscription - system falls back to yfinance automatically

### Issue: Timezone errors
**Solution**: Already handled - all data normalized to timezone-naive
